# CrowdForm Challenge App:

The idea of this challenge is create an app with mock data, where the user is able to:
- Register an account
- Login
- See some mock funds
- See the detail screen for these funds

The project also had to be finished in 48h.

# How to run the app:

In order to start the App, you should

- Clone the repo on your computer
- Once it's cloned, on your terminal, cd into it's folder `cd crodform-challend-app`
- Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run the command `npm run android` if you have and android setup, or `npm run ios` if you have an Apple setup.

Now you're good to go.
